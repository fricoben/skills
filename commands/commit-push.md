Analyze the current git changes, create a short but relevant commit message (max 50 characters), commit all changes, and push to the main branch. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Run `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Generate a concise, descriptive commit message that captures the essence of the changes
4. Stage all changes with `git add .`
5. Commit with the generated message
6. Push to main with `git push origin main`

Make sure to follow conventional commit format when appropriate (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", etc.).

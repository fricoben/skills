# Managing Accounts

Shard uses Microsoft OAuth to authenticate with Minecraft. You need to add at least one account to play.

## Adding an Account

1. Click the **Accounts** button in the sidebar (or the account avatar)
2. Click **Add Account**
3. A device code will appear - copy it
4. Click the link to open Microsoft's login page
5. Paste the code and sign in with your Microsoft account
6. Once authenticated, Shard will fetch your Minecraft profile

## Switching Accounts

If you have multiple accounts:

1. Click the account avatar in the sidebar
2. Select a different account from the list
3. The active account is shown with a checkmark

## Account Details

Click on an account to view:

- **Username**: Your Minecraft username
- **UUID**: Your unique player identifier
- **Skin**: Your current Minecraft skin

You can also upload a new skin from this view.

## Removing an Account

1. Go to Accounts view
2. Click the **...** menu on an account
3. Select **Remove Account**

This only removes the account from Shard; it doesn't affect your Microsoft account.

## Token Storage

Account tokens are stored in `~/.shard/accounts.json`. This file contains:

- **Access token**: Short-lived token for API calls
- **Refresh token**: Long-lived token to get new access tokens

Tokens are refreshed automatically when needed. If you ever need to re-authenticate, remove and re-add the account.

## CLI Authentication

You can also add accounts via the CLI:

```bash
# Start device code flow
shard auth login

# List accounts
shard auth list

# Set active account
shard auth use <username>
```

See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for more commands.

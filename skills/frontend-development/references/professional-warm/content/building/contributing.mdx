# Contributing

We welcome contributions to Shard! Here's how to get started.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports**: Open an issue describing the bug
- **Feature requests**: Open an issue describing the feature
- **Code**: Submit a pull request
- **Documentation**: Improve docs or add examples
- **Testing**: Try Shard and report your experience

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Try the latest version
3. Gather reproduction steps

Include in your report:
- Shard version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs if relevant

## Pull Requests

### Before You Start

1. Check if an issue exists for what you want to do
2. For large changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Fork the repository

### Development Flow

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shard.git
cd shard

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Make your changes
# ...

# Test
cargo test
cd desktop && bun run test

# Commit (use conventional commits)
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

# Push
git push origin feat/my-feature
```

### PR Guidelines

- **One feature per PR**: Keep PRs focused
- **Tests**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Docs**: Update docs if behavior changes
- **Format**: Run `cargo fmt` and `prettier`
- **Conventional commits**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation

## Code Review

All PRs require review before merging. Reviewers will:

1. Check code quality and style

Be patient - maintainers are volunteers!

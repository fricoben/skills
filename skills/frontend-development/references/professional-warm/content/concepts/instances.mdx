# Instances

An instance is a materialized game directory, ready to launch Minecraft.

## Location

```
~/.shard/instances/<profile-id>/
├── mods/               # Symlinks to content store
│   ├── sodium.jar → ../../store/mods/sha256/a3f2...
│   └── lithium.jar → ../../store/mods/sha256/b7c8...
├── resourcepacks/      # Symlinks to content store
├── shaderpacks/        # Symlinks to content store
├── config/             # Copied from overrides
├── saves/              # World data (created by Minecraft)
└── options.txt         # Minecraft settings
```

## Materialization

When you launch a profile, Shard:

1. **Creates** the instance directory if needed
2. **Symlinks** enabled content from the store
3. **Copies** override files from the profile
4. **Preserves** existing saves and configs

### Symlinks

Content files are symlinked, not copied. This means:
- Instant materialization (no file copying)
- No additional disk space
- Changes to the store are reflected immediately

### Overrides

Files in `~/.shard/profiles/<id>/overrides/` are copied into the instance. This is where you put:
- Custom config files
- Profile-specific settings
- Any files not in the content store

## Instance Lifecycle

### Fresh Launch

On first launch, Shard creates the instance from scratch.

### Subsequent Launches

Shard updates symlinks to match the current profile state:
- New content is linked
- Removed content is unlinked
- Disabled content is unlinked

### Saves and Configs

World saves and configs created by Minecraft are preserved between launches. They live in the instance directory and aren't affected by profile changes.

## Resetting an Instance

To reset an instance to a clean state:

```bash
shard instance reset "Profile Name"
```

This removes:
- All symlinks
- Config files from overrides

It preserves:
- World saves (unless you specify `--include-saves`)

## Instance Directory Structure

```
instances/<profile>/
├── mods/                 # Mod JARs (symlinked)
├── resourcepacks/        # Resource packs (symlinked)
├── shaderpacks/          # Shader packs (symlinked)
├── config/               # Mod configs (from Minecraft)
├── saves/                # World saves
├── logs/                 # Minecraft logs
├── crash-reports/        # Crash reports
├── screenshots/          # Screenshots
└── options.txt           # Minecraft options
```

## Why Instances?

Separating instances from profiles provides:

1. **Clean slate**: Profile changes don't affect running games
2. **Rollback**: Reset to profile state anytime
3. **Portability**: Profiles are portable; instances are local
4. **Inspection**: Easy to see exactly what's running

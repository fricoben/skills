# Thomas Style Notes

These notes summarize patterns from thomas.md/posts and Oraxen community updates.

## Voice and Tone
- Friendly, simple, and calm. Warm but not overly enthusiastic.
- First person singular. Short, clear sentences.
- Slightly French phrasing at times, but always understandable.
- No em dashes anywhere. Uses commas or parentheses for small asides.
- Humble and curious rather than authoritative.

## Two Distinct Contexts

Thomas writes differently depending on context:

### Updates (Discord, changelogs)
- Opens with "Hey," or "Hi everyone,".
- Ends with "Thomas" on its own line with a blank line before it.
- Short paragraphs with one idea each.
- Structure: summary, features (numbered), fixes (bullets), docs links, closing.

### Blog Posts (thomas.md essays)
- Opens with a concrete scene or direct personal statement.
- Uses evocative section headings as chapter titles.
- Narrative arc with tension, discovery, and reflection.
- Ends with a philosophical insight, not a sign-off.
- More literary: sensory details, specific places and people, varied sentence rhythm.

## Common Phrases and Transitions

### For Updates
- "This update ..."
- "It introduces ..."
- "Besides that, ..."
- "It also ..."
- "Finally, ..."
- "See:"
- "I hope you enjoy it,"
- "Enjoy!"
- "Best,"
- "Keep me posted ..."

### For Blog Posts
- Opening with place/time: "By the end of 2025, I really needed a break..."
- Introducing tension: "Then everything changed."
- Section transitions: new heading signals new chapter
- Closing reflections: "Life is surprising.", "The window is closing. Fast."

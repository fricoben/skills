# Your First Profile

A profile in Shard is a complete Minecraft setup: a version, optional mod loader, and your selected mods, resource packs, and shaders.

## Creating a Profile

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+N`
2. Enter a name for your profile (e.g., "Survival World")
3. Select a Minecraft version
4. Optionally, choose a mod loader:
   - **Vanilla** - No mods, just Minecraft
   - **Fabric** - Lightweight, fast-loading mods
   - **Forge** - Traditional mod ecosystem
   - **NeoForge** - Modern Forge fork

5. Click **Create Profile**

## Adding Mods

1. Select your profile from the sidebar
2. Click the **Store** tab to browse mods
3. Search for a mod by name (e.g., "Sodium")
4. Click **Install** to add it to your profile

Shard automatically:
- Downloads the correct version for your Minecraft version and loader
- Handles dependencies (e.g., Fabric API for Fabric mods)
- Stores the mod in the content-addressed store for deduplication

## Launching

1. Make sure you have an account added (see [Managing Accounts](/docs/getting-started/accounts))
2. Click the **Play** button in the profile header
3. Shard will:
   - Download any missing game files
   - Materialize your instance directory
   - Launch Minecraft with your profile's mods and settings

## Profile Templates

Shard includes templates for common setups:

- **Fabric + Performance** - Sodium, Lithium, and other performance mods
- **Fabric + Shaders** - Iris Shaders with Sodium
- **Vanilla** - Clean Minecraft, no mods

Use templates as a starting point and customize from there.

## CLI Alternative

You can also create profiles from the command line:

```bash
# Create a vanilla profile
shard profile create "My Profile" --version 1.21.4

# Create a Fabric profile
shard profile create "Modded" --version 1.21.4 --loader fabric
```

See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for more commands.
